Hi there! Thanks for your interest to contribute to my **bin** list! Before
doing so, please read the following guidelines.

## Contributions

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Improve documentation

Currently the documentation is all in the [README](README.md), with a simple
formatting. If you think any of them can be improved upon, feel free to edit the
README and open a pull-request.

Adding help and usage to commands themselves that don't have them is also a
great way to help.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren't reproducible, or are just incorrect. Help
make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

We’re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome. It’s often good to first create an issue to
report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to prevent
you from doing unnecessary work.

## Submitting an issue

- The issue tracker is for issues
- Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
  issue
- Ensure you’re using the latest version
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue, error
  message, version, operating system, etcetera
- The more time you put into an issue, the more we will

## Submitting a pull request

- Don’t include unrelated changes
- If you're not the original author of the binary, please, credit the original
  author. If you don't know who created it but you know it wasn't you, you may
  leave it blank. But don't try to pass something as your work if it is not.
- If submitting a new binary, remember to add a descriptive information on how
  to use the binary to the [README](README.md)
